17. Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation-2
    The generation of data-driven prognostics models requires the availability of data sets with run-to-failure
    trajectories. To contribute to the development of these methods, the data set provides a new realistic data set of
    run-to-failure trajectories for a small fleet of aircraft engines under realistic flight conditions. The damage
    propagation modelling used for the generation of this synthetic data set builds on the modeling strategy from
    previous work. The data set was generated with the Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (C-MAPSS)
    dynamical model. The data set has been provided by the NASA Prognostics Center of Excellence (PCoE) in collaboration
    with ETH Zurich and PARC.
